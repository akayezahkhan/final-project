        <p className="flex justify-center font-medium">We have three roles here on earth: to learn, to love, and to live. When we stop learning, we start to stagnate and die. When we stop loving, we lose our sense of purpose and become self-centered. When we limit our living, we deny the world the benefits of our talents. Jim Cathcart, The Acorn Principle</p>
